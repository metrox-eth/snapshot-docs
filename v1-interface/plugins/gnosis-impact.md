# Gnosis Impact

The [Gnosis Impact app](https://impact.gnosis.io/) is a tool for projecting into the future. The app uses simple analysis of prediction markets to expose the price that traders are willing to pay for an asset in the condition that a particular event occurs. This information is an invaluable decision-making tool as it gives insight into how the market perceives the event impacting the relative value of asset pairs.

## Setup

For the final step in creating a GnosisDAO Snapshot poll, make sure youâ€™re in touch with a [GnosisDAO Admin forum moderator](https://forum.gnosis.io/u/gnosisdao/) to obtain the Gnosis Impact **conditionID**. In the future, this step will be more user friendly, so that participants can easily do this on their own.
