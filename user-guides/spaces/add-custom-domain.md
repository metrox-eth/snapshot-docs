# Add a custom domain

By adding a custom domain to your space, you can whitelabel the Snapshot website and present your community with a fully branded governance experience. This feature allows you to display only your specific space at your custom URL and even customize colors to match your brand identity.

### Examples

More than 400 DAOs already use custom domains for their governance, such as:

[vote.balancer.fi](https://vote.balancer.fi/)\
[vote.morpho.org](https://vote.morpho.org/)\
[vote.sushi.com](https://vote.sushi.com/)

### Requirements

To enable this whitelabel experience, you must subscribe to our [Turbo plan](turbo-plan.md). Once your subscription is active, follow the setup process below.

### Setup steps

#### 1. Add a CNAME record

Go to your DNS provider or registrar and create a new CNAME record.

* Host: _your custom domain_ (for example, vote.myprotocol.xyz)
* Points to: `cname.snapshot.box`

#### 2. Contact us

After you have created the CNAME record, let us know youâ€™d like to enable whitelabel. Reach out to us through our [Help center](https://help.snapshot.box), [Discord](https://discord.snapshot.org), or [Telegram](https://t.me/bonustrack).&#x20;
